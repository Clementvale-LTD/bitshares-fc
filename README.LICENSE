Additionally, this software package incorporates various pieces of code licensed
under the BSD or MIT licenses and their variants. This adds the additional
requirement of mentioning the respective authors and licenses in binary
distributions as well. Obviously, these licenses must also be kept in the
source.

On 2018-02-18, Dan has kindly given us permission to relicense (see
licenses/fc-relicense-permission.png) this library under the terms of the MIT
license (see LICENSE).


The following additional terms have to be published along with binaries
of this software. Some of these may be used in the form of dynamically linked
libraries distributed separately, most notably libudt. In that case,
the respective licenses do not apply to the binary of this software.
Also, some of the files are only used for building binaries of this software,
without becoming an actual part of those binaries. Their respective licenses
also do not apply to the binaries.
